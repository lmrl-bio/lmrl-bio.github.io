We will distribute travel awards of up to $500 to offset the cost of attendance. To be considered for an award, you must submit [this form](https://forms.gle/FHN3BtJKBMtG523TA) and an abstract by September 15.

Priority will be given to students and early career researchers with selected abstracts and limited funding from other sources. We also believe a diversity of personal and professional backgrounds will enrich the workshop and its impact.
