We are calling for **300-500 word abstracts** from machine learnists, experimental biologists, and everyone in between about topics in machine learning and/or biology with cross-disciplinary relevance (see below). Selected abstracts will be shared online ahead of the workshop and featured in breakout, poster, and lightning talk sessions.

We will *not* screen full paper submissions. Rather, following the workshop, we will organize the community to distill insights from our discussions into a white paper on learning meaningful representations of life.

Abstracts selected for talks will be awarded **$250**, equivalent to the workshop registration fee. We encourage those with limited funding to apply for up to **$500** of support under [Travel Awards](https://lmrl-bio.github.io/travel).

## Topics

While industry has driven empirical progress in predictive learning, the life sciences are poised to drive a renaissance in representation learning. The central question of LMRL is:

*What do we need -- experimentally and computationally -- to systematically construct, apply, and assess representations of biological systems?*

To meaningfully address this interdisciplinary question:

- We welcome **machine learnists without biology expertise** to share insights and examples of representation learning from science and industry broadly, from which biologists might draw inspiration.
- We welcome **experimental and computational biologists** to discuss scientific challenges, experimental capacities, and ways of modelling the genome, biomolecules/drugs, cells, tissues, or organism-level phenotypes like disease and behavior.

In doing so, submissions might consider any of the following:

- What scientific challenges are most important and ripe to address?
- What existing data is most relevant and what new experimental capacities would be most helpful?
- What existing work is most inspiring and what does it lack?
- What aspects of machine learning are most relevant and where is progress needed?
- How might predictive tasks best support representation learning?
- How might creative benchmarks or community standards focus our efforts?
- How might closing the loop on experiment and computation accelerate our efforts?
- How might we effectively make and measure progress together, across machine learning and biology, academia and industry?

We encourage submissions of all kinds, including work focused on questions rather than answers and creative visions for interdisciplinary progress. Submissions may range from entirely experimental to entirely theoretical -- provided they are relevant to a cross-disciplinary audience.

If your first language is experimental or computational biology, imagine your reader is fascinated by biology but has not taken a course since college. If your first language is machine learning, imagine your reader is data savvy but has no advanced training in machine learning.

## Guidelines

Deadlines are Mondays by midnight, PDT.

- **September 16: Deadline for abstract and travel award submission.**
- September 30: Notification of selection, posters, talks, and travel awards.
- December 9: Deadline for uploading posters and slides.

Submit an abstract using this form:

[https://forms.gle/ub47S8xWGnsVa8Bg8](https://forms.gle/ub47S8xWGnsVa8Bg8)

Abstracts will be evaluated through double-blind review for originality, clarity, quality, and relevance. Abstracts may have multiple authors; in fact, we encourage interdisciplinary submissions. Conversely, one author may appear on multiple abstracts to which they have significantly contributed. Previously published material is welcome provided it is topical and would promote interesting discussion; please note it as such. Authors retain full copyright and selection does not preclude publication of the same material in another journal or conference.

Note that we cannot guarantee workshop registration, so it is critical to **register yourself** starting at 8am PDT on September 6, fully refundable until November 28.
