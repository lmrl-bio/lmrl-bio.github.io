## Participate

LMRL will be featuring some of the best efforts in biology and machine learning to spur the next generation of data-driven biological problem-solving. An emphasis on interpretable learning of structure and principles will be applied to work on the level of the **genome, molecule, cells, and phenotype**. The call for abstracts and travel awards has closed; to join the conference, please  [submit a poster proposal](https://lmrl-bio.github.io/call) by October 20. We hope you'll join us!

LRML at NeurIPS will begin at 9:00am on Friday, December 13th, at the Vancouver Convention Center. Talks and discussions by:
