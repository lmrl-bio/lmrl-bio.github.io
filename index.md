The workshop will be held on Friday, December 13 at [NeurIPS 2019](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/) in Vancouver. The main conference sells out quickly; the workshops may as well. Unfortuately, we cannot guarantee a spot at the main conference under any condition. We recommend [registering](https://nips.cc/Register/view-registration), refundable until November 28.
